# PokeMMO Help

Welcome to **PokeMMO Help**! üéÆ‚ú® This project provides essential tools for Pok√©mon trainers in **PokeMMO**, helping them calculate capture chances, search for Pok√©mon, and analyze type effectiveness.

## üöÄ Features

### **Capture Chance**

- Allows users to calculate the probability of catching a Pok√©mon in **PokeMMO** using the official Pok√©mon formula.
- Fetches Pok√©mon data (Gen 1-5) from **Pok√©API**, excluding specific Pok√©mon listed in a custom JSON file.
- Live search with an autocomplete suggestion box that filters Pok√©mon names as the user types.
- Fetches essential data such as **HP, Speed, Weight, Catch Rate, Type, and Image** when a Pok√©mon is selected.
- Adjusts catch rates for **PokeMMO-specific Pok√©mon** using a separate JSON file.
- Supports **Alpha Pok√©mon**, applying their unique catch rates and a red aura animation.
- Includes input fields for **Level and HP, along with a Status Condition selector** that applies visual indicators for different effects.
- Dynamically updates a **health bar** matching the in-game design based on user input.
- Provides a **Pok√© Ball selector** with built-in conditions (e.g., fishing checks, type-based multipliers).
- The capture chance updates **dynamically in real time**, ensuring a smooth user experience without the need for manual refreshes
- **Theme selector** for background customization, allowing users to submit custom themes via Discord.
- **Language selection** (Currently only English, with more planned).

### **Coming Soon**

- **Pok√©mon Search:** A tool that will allow users to filter Pok√©mon by **abilities, moves, base stats, egg groups, and types**.
- **Type Chart:** A calculator to evaluate type effectiveness in battles, including an **inverse type mode**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **Capture Chance**

1. The app fetches **Pok√©mon data** from **Pok√©API**, filtering out ineligible Pok√©mon using a JSON file.
2. Users select a Pok√©mon through a **live search suggestion box**.
3. Upon selection, the app retrieves **stats, image, and catch rate**, checking a separate JSON file for PokeMMO-specific rates.
4. If the Pok√©mon has an **Alpha** variant, a checkbox allows switching to its custom catch rate with a red aura effect.
5. Users enter **Level, HP percentage, or 1 HP mode**, which affects the calculation.
6. A **Status Condition** selector applies the respective multiplier.
7. A **Pok√© Ball selector** determines the ball's capture multiplier, considering conditions like fishing or Pok√©mon type.
8. The capture chance is calculated using Pok√©mon's **total HP, current HP, catch rate, status multiplier, and ball multiplier**.
9. **Live updates** ensure the capture chance adjusts immediately upon any user input change.
10. A **theme selector** allows users to pick from different background images, with community submissions accepted via Discord.

### **Coming Soon**

- **Pok√©mon Search**: A powerful Pok√©mon lookup tool with detailed filters.
- **Type Chart**: A dynamic type calculator with an optional **inverse type mode**.
