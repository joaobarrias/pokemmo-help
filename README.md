# PokeMMO Tools

Welcome to **PokeMMO Tools**! üéÆ‚ú® This project provides various tools designed to help you calculate important in-game statistics for **PokeMMO**, an online multiplayer Pok√©mon game. Currently, the tool includes a **Capture Chance**, along with future features like the **Stats Preview** and **Type Effectiveness** (coming soon!).

## üöÄ Features

### **Capture Chance**
- **Real-time Data Fetching:** The calculator fetches essential Pok√©mon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co), ensuring up-to-date and accurate statistics.
- **Custom Catch Rates:** Some Pok√©mon in PokeMMO have unique catch rates compared to the official Pok√©mon games. This tool uses a custom **JSON file** to handle these specific rates.
- **Alpha Pok√©mon Support:** Includes functionality for calculating the capture chances for **Alpha Pok√©mon**, which have distinct catch rates in PokeMMO.
- **Suggestions & Autocomplete:** As you type in the name of a Pok√©mon, the tool will suggest possible matches to choose from.
- **HP & Catch Rate Modifiers:** You can toggle between exact HP values and percentage HP values to get a more precise calculation for your capture chances.

### **Coming Soon**
- **Stats Preview:** A tool that will allow you to calculate the stats of your Pok√©mon, based on their IVs, EVs and Level.
- **Type Effectiveness:** A calculator to evaluate the effectiveness of different Pok√©mon types against each other in battle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **Capture Chance**
- **Pok√©mon Input:** The tool allows users to input a Pok√©mon name, and it fetches the relevant data for the capture chance calculations. This includes data from the **PokeAPI** to retrieve the Pok√©mon's species information, such as catch rate and base stats, which are used in the calculation. Custom catch rates specific to PokeMMO are also incorporated, overriding official values where necessary.
- **Alpha Pok√©mon:** The **Alpha Pok√©mon** checkbox adjusts the catch rate with a different formula and adds a dynamic visual effect, including red smoke and a glowing background, mimicking the actual Alpha appearance in the game.
- **Status Condition Multiplier:** The selected status condition (e.g., paralysis or sleep) modifies the catch rate. A corresponding status icon is displayed on the Pok√©mon image, making it easier to track the Pok√©mon's current condition.
- **HP Input & Display:** You can input a percentage or fixed HP value (e.g., 1 HP for False Swipe). The health bar visually reflects the Pok√©mon's health with an in-game styled design, dynamically adjusting based on their current HP and total HP calculated from base HP and level, providing an immersive representation during capture.
- **Pok√©ball Selector:** The Pok√©ball multiplier is applied to the calculation of the capture chances based on your selection of Pok√©ball.

### **Coming Soon**
- **Stats Preview** 
- **Type Effectiveness**
