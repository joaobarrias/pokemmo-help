# PokeMMO Capture Chance Calculator

Welcome to the **PokeMMO Capture Chance Calculator**! üéÆ‚ú® This tool helps you calculate the capture chances of Pok√©mon in **PokeMMO**, an online multiplayer Pok√©mon game. The calculator uses real-time data fetched from the **PokeAPI** and includes custom catch rates specifically for PokeMMO, as some Pok√©mon have different catch rates than their official counterparts.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** The calculator fetches essential Pok√©mon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co), ensuring up-to-date and accurate statistics.
- **Custom Catch Rates:** Some Pok√©mon in PokeMMO have unique catch rates compared to the official Pok√©mon games. This tool uses a custom **JSON file** to handle these specific rates.
- **Alpha Pok√©mon Support:** Includes functionality for calculating the capture chances for **Alpha Pok√©mon**, which have distinct catch rates in PokeMMO.
- **Suggestions & Autocomplete:** As you type in the name of a Pok√©mon, the tool will suggest possible matches to choose from.
- **HP & Catch Rate Modifiers:** You can toggle between exact HP values and percentage HP values to get a more precise calculation for your capture chances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **PokeAPI Integration:** The tool fetches Pok√©mon species data to get the basic stats, including the standard catch rate. This is complemented by custom catch rates stored in a separate **JSON file** that overrides the official values where necessary.
- **Alpha Pok√©mon:** The **Alpha Pok√©mon** checkbox adjusts the catch rate calculation for these special Pok√©mon, applying a different formula for their capture chances.
- **HP Input:** You can either input a percentage of HP remaining or use a fixed value (e.g., exactly 1 HP for False Swipe) to calculate the catch probability more accurately.
